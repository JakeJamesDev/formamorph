# Formamorph Design System

This guide and the live showcase are the visual authority for Formamorph. They document approved patterns; they do not authorize an app-wide redesign.

> **Open the live reference:** run the development app, then open `#dev?modal=designSystem` or call `window.__fmDev.goto(undefined, { modal: 'designSystem' })`.

The showcase uses production components and local demonstration state. It does not save preferences or call an endpoint, and its lazy route is excluded from production builds.

## Visual foundations

Use semantic values from the app. Do not sample colors from screenshots; HDR and display processing can change them.

| Foundation | Approved source | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Color | [`src/index.css`](../src/index.css) | Use `background`, `foreground`, `card`, `muted`, `accent`, `border`, `input`, `ring`, and semantic status tokens. All supported light/dark palettes override these values. |
| Typography | [`tailwind.config.js`](../tailwind.config.js) and [`typography.tsx`](../src/components/ui/typography.tsx) | Choose the role: `display`, `heading`, `title`, `body`, `label`, `helper`, or `meta`. Use `Hint`, `FieldError`, `SectionTitle`, and `Meta` for secondary text. |
| Font | [`settingsDefaults.ts`](../src/contexts/settingsDefaults.ts) | Inherit `--app-font`. Production font choices and per-font tuning remain authoritative. |
| Borders and radius | [`src/index.css`](../src/index.css) | Use `border`, `input`, and `--radius`; use `h-hairline` or `w-hairline` for dividers. |
| Spacing | Production component classes | Compose the existing 4-unit rhythm: 1rem between rows and 1.5rem between sections in settings surfaces. |
| Focus | Production controls in [`src/components/ui`](../src/components/ui) | Keep the shared two-pixel inset `ring` treatment. Do not replace it with a palette-specific outline. |

Cards use `card` rather than inventing a second panel color. Destructive, success, warning, and information states keep their semantic colors across palettes.

## Pattern: Aligned Settings Stack

**Purpose:** Make a mixed settings form easy to scan while giving controls most of the horizontal space.

**Density:** Comfortable. Sections have 1.5rem between them; rows within a section have 1rem. Controls keep their production heights and typography roles.

### Composition

- Group related rows with a small uppercase section title and a hairline divider.
- At `sm` and wider, use a 1:3 label/control grid. Right-align labels and keep controls left-aligned.
- Below `sm`, stack the label above the control and left-align both.
- Put a short description below its control or beside a checkbox. Keep necessary detail behind the information control.
- Use several suitable widget types. Do not convert every setting into the same control for visual uniformity.
- Use the responsive option switcher for mutually exclusive choices: segmented options at `sm` and wider, a select below `sm`.
- Keep long values inside the control column. Select triggers truncate instead of widening the row.

### Production mapping

| Need | Component |
| --- | --- |
| Section heading and divider | `Section` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Label/control alignment | `Row` and `RowLabel` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Checkbox plus description | `CheckRow` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Segmented desktop / select mobile | `OptionSwitcher` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Slider plus current value | `ValueSlider` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Optional detail | `HintInfo` in [`SettingsRows.tsx`](../src/components/SettingsRows.tsx) |
| Inputs and choices | `Input`, `Checkbox`, `Slider`, `Select`, and `ToggleGroup` in [`src/components/ui`](../src/components/ui) |
| Approved compositions | Display and Output in [`SettingsModal.tsx`](../src/components/modals/SettingsModal.tsx) |

### State reference

| State | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Show a valid initial value with the normal border and text roles. |
| Selected | Use the production selected fill, foreground, and shadow. Do not add a second selection mark unless the control already has one. |
| Disabled | Keep the value readable, reduce opacity, and explain why it is unavailable when the reason is not evident. |
| Focus | Use the shared visible focus ring. Keyboard focus must not rely on hover. |
| Validation | Set `aria-invalid`, connect the message with `aria-describedby`, and use `FieldError`. |
| Overflow | Constrain the control column and preserve the full value through its menu, title, or detail view. |

The live Settings reference shows all six states. Its Display and Output examples reuse the same rows, options, theme registries, font registries, and controls as production.

## Writing in settings

Keep setting descriptions to one sentence, third person, and no more than 12 words. Put necessary additional detail behind `HintInfo`. Do not claim ASD-STE100 compliance from length or tone alone; use the vocabulary, grammar, meaning, and evidence process in the [Writing Guide](Writing-Guide.md).

## Adding an approved pattern

The live shell renders `DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCES` from [`DesignSystemShowcase.tsx`](../src/views/DesignSystemShowcase.tsx). Add one definition with an ID, label, description, and production-backed component; the reference navigation and responsive shell update from that registry.

Add a matching `## Pattern:` section here with its purpose, density, desktop/mobile behavior, component mapping, and applicable states. Demonstrate a new visual pattern inside a representative Formamorph screen at desktop and mobile sizes, then get product approval before adding it to this reference.

The markdown editing and community card tickets extend this registry and guide. They do not need a new showcase shell or another token set.
